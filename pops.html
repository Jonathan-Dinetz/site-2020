                <br><br>

                <a style="text-decoration: underline" id="hover" href="https://www.popsproject.org/index.html">
                    Piedmont for Oakland Public Schools</a> (POPS) is a non profit organization founded by a group of
                friends and I home from school during the summer of 2020. The goal of the organization is to
                leverage the privilege and resources of our hometown, Piedmont, to fight racial inequity in
                education, both inside and outside the “bubble” of Piedmont. POPS runs campaigns to raise money for
                everything from laptops and wifi to providing agricultural education that helps former inmates learn
                sustainable skills. To date, we have raised over $85,000 for such causes. Within Piedmont POPS works
                to facilitate positive cultural change by hosting events that emphasize a wider range of racial
                perspectives within Piedmont’s predominantly white school system.

                <br><br>

                CHALLENGE
                <br><br>

                The POPS project began with us asking what role a white, liberal, upper-class suburb could play in the
                Black Lives Matter movement, and the fight against systemic racism. It was clear that Piedmont’s most
                valuable asset was its resources. In order to unlock the town’s full power in that arena, we would have
                to create trust between the adults in Piedmont—a population of doctors, lawyers and chief executive
                officers—and us: 5 teenagers who had never raised a cent.
                <br><br>

                On top of that we needed to work quickly, especially in our first campaign. We feared that the
                movement
                and protests surrounding the murders of George Flloyd, Breonna Taylor, and many others would lose
                steam
                like so many before it, taking the attention and urgency of Piedmonters down with it. We had to be
                economical in our strategic infrastructure and brutally decisive in our choice of supporting
                materials.


                <br><br>
                Finally, we had a pandemic to work around. We could not host large in-person promotional events to
                get
                the word out about our new organization. Most of our introductions and promotions would be happening
                online, where the competition for eyeballs is more fierce and emotion harder to convey than in
                person.
                <br><br>
                SOLUTION
                <br><br>

                We built an identity that aimed to highlight both the urgency of our cause, through the use of powerful,
                black and white photography, and also a sense of “put-together-ness”—essential to building trust
                with
                donors—through an adherence to strict graphic standards of type, color, and layout.
                <br><br>

                On our website we built a leaderboard for donations, displaying names of leading and recent donors,
                which plays off the competitive nature of the Piedmont community. When showing the site around, the
                leaderboard always grabbed a user’s attention, with parents and parents friends being driven to
                out-do
                one another.

                <br><br>

                On social media we used motion and bright yellow backgrounds in every post in order to more
                efficiently
                display type-heavy messages, catch eyes, and burst through the clutter of the typical social media
                feed.
                We didn’t conduct formal research on the results of our social media presence, but when discussing
                our
                campaigns with some of the high schoolers in town, we were immediately recognized as “the yellow
                account”, indicating our strategy’s success in breaking through to the inundated brain of the social
                media user.

                <br><br>
                Both our campaigns far exceeded our expectations, each raising tens of thousands of dollars to
                combat
                racial inequity in education throughout the East Bay. Some online campaign events have hosted over
                250
                Piedmonters, which have helped build understanding and continued the fight against racial bias
                inside
                and outside Piedmont.
