                Piedmont for Oakland Public Schools (POPS) is a non profit organization founded by a group of friends
                and I home from school during the summer of 2020. The organization is dedicated to addressing the
                educational inequities between my white and wealthy home town of Piedmont, and its underserved next door
                neighbor, Oakland. We have run two campaigns that have raised a total of $85,000 for educational equity
                in Oakland.
                <br><br>

                Challenge
                <br><br>

                Piedmont is unique in that it is a wealthy town but also majority democrat. This combination of wealth
                and liberal politics presents an opportunity to provide significant funding to campaigns for racial
                justice and racial equity.
                <br><br>

                To capitalize on this opportunity we had to delve into unfamiliar territory. In order to gain the trust
                of the largest donors in our community, people that ran companies, law firms and the like, we couldn’t
                just build a go fund me. We had to develop an identity that made us look like more than five teenagers
                doing something they had never done before.
                <br><br>

                Solution
                <br><br>

                For starters we built a full-scale website. The site features a leaderboard which is intended to
                capitalize on the competitive nature of our small community. If Ted and Mary see that Hank and Julie
                donated X amount, they might be inclined to out do them. We were also sure to include detailed
                descriptions of what the funds would be going toward as this is often the main concern of donors to any
                organization.
                <br><br>

                Social Media was very important for establishing our presence in the community as we had very little
                opportunity for in person communication during lockdown. We wanted to break through the clutter of
                instagram and our simple strategy was to make every post yellow. We eventually established ourselves as
                “the yellow account” in our follower’s feeds.
                <br><br>

                Finally, we experimented with other methods of communication and outreach including a small poster
                campaign promoting an up-coming event. Aimed at morning walkers, the goal was to build awareness by
                using quick and vivid lines comparing experiences of oakland and piedmont students during the pandemic.
