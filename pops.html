                <a style="text-decoration: underline" href="https://www.popsproject.org/index.html">Piedmont for
                    Oakland Public Schools</a> (POPS) is a non profit organization
                founded by a group of friends and I home from school during the summer of 2020. The goal of the
                organization is to leverage the privilege and resources of our hometown, Piedmont, to fight racial
                injustice in education, both inside and outside the city limits of our town. POPS runs campaigns to
                raise money for everything from laptops and wifi to providing agricultural education that helps former
                inmates learn new skills. To date, we have raised over $85,000 for such causes. POPS also works to
                facilitate meaningful cultural change within Piedmont by hosting events that emphasize a wider range of
                racial perspectives within Piedmont’s predominantly white school system.

                <br><br>

                CHALLENGE
                <br><br>

                In the beginning, we didn’t know that what we were working on would turn out to become a full-fledged
                non-profit. We only knew that Piedmont’s most valuable asset in the fight against systemic racism was
                its resources. And in order to unlock the town’s full power in that arena, we would have to create trust
                between the adults in Piedmont, a population of doctors, lawyers and chief executive officers, and us, 5
                teenagers who had never raised a dime in our lives.

                <br><br>

                On top of that, we needed to work quickly, especially in our first campaign. The names George Floyd and
                Breonna Taylor have not faded from the country’s conscience, but back in the spring, we feared just
                that. We thought that the movement would certainly lose steam like so many before it, taking the urgency
                of donors down with it. With this in mind we aimed to launch our campaign as soon as possible. Once we
                had our focus settled, we set our launch date for only two weeks out. With such a tight schedule, we had
                to be economical in our strategic infrastructure, and brutally decisive in our choice of supporting
                materials.

                <br><br>

                SOLUTION
                <br><br>

                In order to build an identity which communicated a sense of “put-together-ness” that would deliver the
                large donations that we were looking for, we couldn’t just settle for a Gofundme page. To remove any
                doubt that we could handle thousand-dollar donations, and also to communicate our goals and story more
                comprehensively, we would build a full-scale organization. A website, social media page and, perhaps
                most importantly, a gmail account, would all come together under the roof of a mature, emotive and
                distinctive brand identity.
                <br><br>

                I managed to talk everyone into letting me code my first full-scale website. One of the site’s most
                important features—the leaderboard—plays into an important aspect of Piedmont’s culture: competition.
                This trait is displayed clearly on our local market sandwich menu. Sandwiches are auctioned off to
                families at school fundraising events, and the winner gets their last name applied to whichever sandwich
                they won. This auction allows donors the opportunity to bluntly display their wealth to anyone who is
                hungry for a turkey sub on a given day. To take advantage of this trait, we included a leaderboard,
                front and center on the site’s home page, where donors can display their names, along with the amount
                they donated. As an informal user testing experiment, I showed the site to a few of my parents' friends
                and in less than 30 seconds they were caught up in a conversation about who donated what amount,
                discussing who to best.

                <br><br>

                For social media, we created clean and simple posts that designed to demonstrate our maturity and
                further establish our presence in the local community. We used motion and bright yellow backgrounds in
                every post in order to more efficiently display type-heavy messages, catch eyes, and burst through the
                clutter of the typical social media feed. We didn’t conduct research on the results of our social media
                presence, but when discussing the campaign with some of the high schoolers in town, we were referred to
                as “the yellow account.” To have forged any kind of distinct identity in a brain which absorbs social
                media for two-thirds of it’s waking hours is an accomplishment I am fairly proud of.

                <br><br>
                The POPS project is still growing and quickly finding its place as a permanent force behind the push for
                racial equity both inside and outside of Piedmont.
